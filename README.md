Once you have the RJigsawTools package with 

```
git clone https://github.com/rsmith54/RJigsawTools.git
```

you'll still need a few dependencies. You'll need to get `Ext_RestFrames` and `CommonTools`.

```
git clone https://github.com/lawrenceleejr/Ext_RestFrames.git
#??? for CommonTools?
```

Then you can set up the rc environment:

```
source RJigsawTools/utils/setup.sh
```
